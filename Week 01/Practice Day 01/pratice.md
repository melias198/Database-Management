<h3>2. Give examples of primary key and composite primary key and foreign key 
</h3>

### Primary Key:
A primary key is a unique identifier for each record in a table. It ensures that no two records in the table have the same value for the primary key. Here's an example using a "Students" table:

<h3>3. Describe database relation with proper examples</h3>

### One-to-One Relationship:
<p>When a single element of an entity is associated with a single element of another entity, it is called a one-to-one relationship.

For example, a student has only one identification card and an identification card is given to one person.</p>

### One-to-Many Relationship:
<p>When a single element of an entity is associated with more than one element of another entity, it is called a one-to-many relationship

For example, a customer can place many orders, but an order cannot be placed by many customers.</p>

### Many-to-One Relationship:
<p>When more than one element of an entity is related to a single element of another entity, then it is called a many-to-one relationship.

For example, students have to opt for a single course, but a course can have many students.</p>

### Many-to-Many Relationship:
<p>When more than one element of an entity is associated with more than one element of another entity, this is called a many-to-many relationship.

For example, you can assign an employee to many projects and a project can have many employees.</p>
