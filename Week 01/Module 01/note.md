<h2 align = 'center'> 1. Introduction to DBMS </h2>

<p> A Database Management System (DBMS) is a software system that is designed to manage and organize data in a structured manner. It allows users to create, modify, and query a database, as well as manage the security and access controls for that database. </p>

1. Relational Databases (RDBMS)<br>
2. Object-oriented DBMS (OODBMS)<br>
3. NoSQL DBMS<br>
4. Graph Databases<br>
5. Columnar Databases

<h4>1. Relational Databases (RDBMS):</h4>
<p>A type of DBMS that organizes data into tables (also known as relations) and allows for the creation of relationships between them.</p>

<h4>2. Object-oriented DBMS (OODBMS):</h4>
<p>A type of DBMS that organizes data into objects and allows for the creation of classes and inheritance.</p>

<h4>3. NoSQL DBMS:</h4>
<p>A type of DBMS that does not use the traditional table-based structure of RDBMS. Instead, it uses a more flexible, document-based or key-value-based data model.</p>

<h4>4. Graph Databases:</h4>
<p>A type of NoSQL DBMS that organizes data in the form of nodes and edges, and is optimized for handling relationships between data.</p>

<h4>5. Columnar Databases:</h4>
<p>A type of NoSQL DBMS that organizes data into columns rather than rows, and is optimized for handling large amounts of data.</p>
